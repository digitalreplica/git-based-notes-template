# Shared Digital Memory Project

Welcome to the Shared Digital Memory project, a social experiment to accumulate, refine, and share knowledge. This is a text-focused, git-powered method of organizing not only your own knowledge, but extending it with knowledge other people have shared.

## The Basic Concepts
You create one (or more) git-based "memory" repositories. You fill it with notes, things you've learned, stuff you want to keep. You organize it all with multiple tags in a way that creates threads of memory hints to help you find it later.

You can keep a memory repository total private, share it with a few friends, or open it to the whole world.

## Getting Started
1. Create an account with [Github](https://github.com/). You can also use [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), or any other git-based system.
2. Open https://github.com/digitalreplica/memory
3. Click the "Use this template button."
4. Give your new memory repository a name (like memory). Select if you'd like to make it public or private (you can change this later). If this is something you'd like to share with just a few people, select private.

(More instructions on cloning to local machine.)

## Memories
Memories (or notes) are the building blocks of your knowledge system.
* In the memory folder, create a file using a guid, ending with .md [EXPLAIN]
* Never rename a memory file, because it will break anything linked to it

## Memory Threads
This system makes extensive use of tags to organize information. The use of multiple tags is encouraged, because each additional tag **refines** other tags it's used with.

Say you passion is cooking, and you dutifully tag each recipe with #recipe. You might have hundreds, so looking for just that tag will not be easy. Say you're looking for an old family recipe, so you also search for #family to find recipes tagged with both. It's a #favorite, so you add that as well. There should be far fewer, so it's much easier to pick it out.

This is a memory thread, tags threaded together to find specific things you're looking for. Order isn't important, so you can start with family, then refine by recipes and favorites. Or favorite, then recipes, then family. Every path will get you there.
